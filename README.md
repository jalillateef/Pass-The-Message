# Pass-The-Message

#DESCRIPTION

This project allows you to enter a message within the input field and that message is then displayed in the 'last messsage delivered' area. If no text is in put an alert pops up that says 'PLEASE ENTER A MESSAGE!', then dissapears after 3 seconds. 

#WHY
I made this project to get a better understanding of the setTimeout() function and to get a refresher on conditional statements.
